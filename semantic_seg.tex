\subsubsection{\textit{Pixel Accuracy}}
\subsubsection{\textit{Mean Accuracy}}
\subsubsection{\textit{Intersection over Union} (IoU)}
\label{semantic:IoU}

Após a criação dessa métrica, outras variações ganharam repercussão, das quais destaca-se \textit{mean Intersection-over-Union} (mIoU), a qual é utilizada em trabalhos como \cite{Mohan2020}.


\subsection{Considerações Finais da Seção}
For example, for a pedestrian detection system, the whole body of person should belong to the same segment; how- ever, for an action recognition system, it might be necessary to segment different body parts into different classes. Other forms of image segmentation can focus on the most important object in a scene. A particular class of problem called saliency detection [14] is born from this. Other variants of this domain can be foreground-background separation problems. In many systems, such as im- age retrieval or visual question answering, it is often necessary to count the number of objects. Instance-specific segmentation addresses that issue.
