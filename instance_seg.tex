\subsubsection{Mask R-CNN}
that can create a pixel-wise mask for each object in an image.
Mask R-CNN is an extension of the popular Faster R-CNN object detection architecture.
The Faster R-CNN method generates two things for each object in the image:
 - Its class
 - The bounding box coordinates
Mask R-CNN adds a third branch to this which outputs the object mask as well.
It also returns the mask for each proposal.
Mask R-CNN is the current state-of-the-art for image segmentation and runs at 5 fps.
